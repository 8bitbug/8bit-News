            Changes to hosting on Replit
        Starting on January 1st, 2024, Deployments will become the only way to host on Replit.
        Autoscale & static deployments are included in the Replit Core plan. Alternatively, autoscale & static deployments will be < 20 cents per month for most users.
        </p>
        <p class="Replit-p">
            Replit is making changes to its hosting services.
             Always On will be fully removed from the product on January 1st, 2024, and after that, 
             Deployments will be the only way to host applications on Replit. 
             Autoscale and Static deployments will be less than 20 cents per month or included in the Hacker and Pro plans. 
             Repl.co domains will transition to replit.dev and will only be accessible when someone is in the editor.
              If you are currently hosting anything on Replit, it is recommended that you migrate to Deployments before the new year.
               These changes are being made to improve performance, security, and built-in dev/prod environments.
                The company is beginning the process of deprecating Always On and replacing it with Deployments, which is a scalable infrastructure built to serve millions of users. 
                These changes are with the benefit of users in mind, and the company needs to make money to remain as good as today.
