                    A new Unity pricing policy was announced recently it made many developers angry and Unity is getting A lot of backlash
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Unity has made significant changes to its pricing and packaging updates, which were met with widespread criticism from developers. The revised pricing model includes the following key updates:
Unity Personal plan: The Runtime Fee will not apply to games made with this plan, and the revenue cap for the plan has been increased to $200,000
Runtime Fee: The fee will only apply to games made with the next version of Unity, which is expected to launch in 2024
The fee will be calculated based on either a 2.5% revenue share or an amount based on new monthly active users
Thresholds for Runtime Fee: Games must meet two thresholds to be subject to the fee: $1 million in gross revenue (trailing 12 months) and 1 million initial engagements (presumably meaning installs)
LTS version: The Runtime Fee policy will only apply to the next LTS Unity version shipping in 2024, meaning that games currently shipped and in development will not be included unless upgraded to the new version
Self-reporting: Instead of using proprietary software to track installs, Unity will rely on users to self-report their install counts
These changes aim to address the concerns and negative reactions from the development community. However, it remains to be seen how successful Unity will be in regaining the trust of developers and addressing their concerns.
